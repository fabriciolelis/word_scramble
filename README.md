# Word Scramble
This repository contains final work from ITA classes. The purpose of the task is to create a game <br />
where words are shuffled and the user must guess them. The method to shuffle the words can be done <br />
in two ways: **randomly** or **reversing the order the letters**, the first pass being the last and <br />
vice versa. **The scrambler is chosen randomly**. There are two types of games, the difference <br />
between them is the number of words that are read from the word bank, the number of attempts that <br />
can be made to hit a word and the total amount of errors that can be had in the game. **The game mode <br />
is chosen per game user**.
