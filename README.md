# Word Scramble
This repository contains final work from ITA classes. The purpose of the task is to create a game where words are shuffled and the user must guess them. The method to shuffle the words can be done in two ways: **randomly** or **reversing the order the letters**, the first pass being the last and vice versa. **The scrambler is chosen randomly**. There are two types of games, the difference 
between them is the number of words that are read from the word bank, the number of attempts that can be made to hit a word and the total amount of errors that can be had in the game. **The game mode is chosen per game user**.
